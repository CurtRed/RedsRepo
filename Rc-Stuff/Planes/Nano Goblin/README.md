## General Nano Goblin notes

### Micro-Stalls/Porpising
  
  - [From rc forums](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2955321-STRIX-Nano-Goblin/page391)
    > porpoising usually means either too much servo travel on the elevator control or tail heavy. should only be around 5-6mm up from neutral and 5-6mm down for 10mm total, for maiden. If it is like 18mm or more then it makes the plane nigh unflyable at launch. I didn't pay close attntion to this at first and made a bunch of unsuccessful launches. reviewed the build video, lowered my servo throws and then it launched nicely. And planks don't have empennage way back so are more sensitive to CG placement
