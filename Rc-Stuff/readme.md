  ## Important:

  ### Update Everything
    I reccomend updating everything to the newest stable release before starting.  
The firmware most things ship with is usually way out of date and important fixes happen often.  
Once set up and flying, update only when you want some new feature, etc.  
The "Release Tab" of each project will show highlights of the changes, along with any important info in that update.  
F.y.i. Cool stuff is constantly getting added to everything so its worth occasionally checking.

 To update, use the LATEST release of these updaters:
   - Radio: Edgetx Buddy
   - Transmitter inside radio: Elrs Configurator
   - Reciever on plane: Elrs Configurator
   - Flight Controller: Inav Configurator
   - Esc: [EscConfigurator](escconfigurator.com)
   - Vtx and Vrx may need updating too with Walksnail tool.
